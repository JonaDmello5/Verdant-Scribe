## Core Features:

- Visual Garden Display: Display each post as a unique plant in a visual garden interface.
- Reading as Growth: Visually represent reading engagement through plant growth.
- Gardening Actions: Use metaphors for content management, such as 'Plant a new seed,' 'Pruning,' and 'Composting'.
